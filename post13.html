                <p class="post-text">2020 will surely go down as one of the most important years in Oscar history. It
                    was the first time since the start of the Academy Awards in 1929 that a foreign film won the best
                    picture and only 11 have ever been nominated. Though the Oscars do catch a lot of heat for their
                    biases (especially in the animated category) a lot of people still consider it to be the highest
                    achievement for anyone in the movie industry. So it was a pleasant surprise when Parasite won the
                    best picture (and Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best International Feature Film). The win
                    is even more impressive when considering his competition form Quentin Tarantino to Martin Scorsese.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">All things considered here are 6 reasons why parasite won the best picture and why
                    you should watch it. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">The Director</h2>

                <p class="post-text">The director is one of the if not the most important person in the film making
                    process. A good director can make the best out of even a subpar script. Bong Joon Ho is easily one
                    of the best and most unique directors working today. All of his movies have a special feel to them,
                    they are distinctly his, just as you can tell its a Tarantino movie. All of his movies are highly
                    critically acclaimed (yes all). Another thing most prominent in his movies is a social message, from
                    Snowpiercer to Okja. And he manages to pull it off without it seeming forced for ham-fisted in any
                    way.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">The actors</h2>

                <p class="post-text">It is a shame that Song Kang-ho (who plays the father) did not receive any
                    nominations in the acting category. He is one of the best actors in the Korean film industry mainly
                    famous for his roles as the everyday common man. A lot of people define his work with Bong Joon Ho
                    as a great actor-director collaboration. He frequently shows up in his movies either as the lead or
                    a very important supporting actor. Both of them have such good chemistry together that he has given
                    his best performances in Bongs films and Bong has made the best movies with him as the lead.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">The impact </h2>

                <p class="post-text">There is no denying the impact Parasite will have on the movie industry. People
                    have started to notice the cinema outside there comfort zone. A lot more people are now intrested in
                    Korean movies. For him to beat heavy hitters like Tarantino and Scorsese is very encouraging for
                    upcoming directors. Even HBO saw gold with parasite and is now making a mini-series based in the
                    Parasite world with Bong as executive producer and will explore stories "that happen in between the
                    sequences in the film". </p>
                <p class="post-text">Side note his earlier movie Snowpeicer is also coming back as a tv series. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">The Cinematography </h2>

                <p class="post-text">There's a reason why everyone on youtube is gushing over the cinematography of this
                    movie and breaking don every little scene. every frame is so well that out and so perfectly
                    executed. From the view of the rain from the Park family house to them having to descend the
                    mountain to go to their house. It also has one of the best montage scene is the last decade shows
                    the best use of the technique.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">The Story</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Every year there are trends in the movie industry, certain things that are similar
                    between movies whether it be intentional or unintentional. This year a lot of movies focused on the
                    segregation of people based on the economy, the discrepancy in the distribution of wealth. Another
                    major movie that did the same in 2019 was US by Jordan Peele (another good movie to look out for).
                    Parasite manages to tackle all of this while telling an unpredictable thriller that unfolds so
                    perfectly that you are surprised at how many things have happened. It is a great example of
                    storytelling at its finest.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;"> Because its a damn good movie</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Keeping the hype and the social messaging aside it easily is one of the most
                    perfect movies of the year, from the basic to the most complicated parts it works flawlessly, the
                    score is amazing always keeping you on the edge of the seat, it keeps you entertained, keeps you
                    waiting, keeps you thinking all the while telling a compelling and thought-provoking story.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text"> If you watch Parasite and you want to see what else Korean cinema has to offer
                    than there are a lot more good movies that you can check out.
