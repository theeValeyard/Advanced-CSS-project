                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Fleabag</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Fleabag is a comedy show about a young woman who is trying to cope up with hassles
                    of everyday life in the city of London. It is a show about a dry witted angry woman who tries to
                    deal with tragedy by rejecting everyone who tries to help her. The show is really great, it revolves
                    around a single character known as fleabag. Fleabag is one of the best written characters of all
                    time. The depth of her character needs to be understood through different dimensions rather than
                    one. We see the entire show from the perspective of the main character. She reveals angles to her
                    personality that we had not expected. The show uses perspective to structure the entire story.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> It is not a very big series, you can ideally complete it one sitting. It has two
                    seasons with six episodes each, and each episode is approximately 25 minutes long. Season two of
                    fleabag aired in March 2019. It is an award winning mini series and when it comes to being
                    entertained, just know that all those awards were well earned.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Barry</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Barry is a strange show but in a good way. It is about a guy named Barry who is a
                    professional assassin who accidentally finds out that his real passion is acting. So, he joins an
                    acting class to follow his dreams. He is a very skilled killer, but he is a terrible actor. The show
                    is as brutal as it is funny. He wants to be good at acting because of the fact that he really likes
                    it, and that all that killing has made me lose a part of himself. It is definitely a show worth
                    watching, it is a perfect projection of comedy and action.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> The show has two seasons with eight episodes each and the main character Barry is
                    played by Bill Hader. It is an engaging series with a unique storyline. So, there is a good chance
                    that you would not regret watching Barry. It is an award winning show and you will soon find out
                    why, if you actually choose to watch it.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Succession</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Succession is one of the most hilarious shows you will ever watch. It is a business
                    comedy. So, if you are a business person, you would really like this show. The basic theme of the
                    show is that the Logan family is widely known to control the biggest media and entertainment giant
                    in the world. The story revolves around, who would inherit the company after the father retires. The
                    father feels that he is growing old and that he would have to retire soon. So, he tells his three
                    sons and daughter to prove themselves. The sons are absolutely terrible and stupid and none of them
                    are capable of running the company. The daughter seems most capable of actually being able to handle
                    the company. But she is the youngest of her siblings so proving herself to her father also becomes
                    challenging.</p>
                <p class="post-text">However, watching them try to win their father over is entertaining and amusing. It
                    is another award winning show with two seasons with ten episodes each. Succession is a brilliant
                    show and it is definitely worth your time. </p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Chernobyl</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Chernobyl is a mini series with just five episodes in total. The theme is based
                    around one of the worst manmade disasters ever faced by humanity. Which was, the Chernobyl nuclear
                    disaster of 1986. The show is considered one of the best TV shows of not just the year, but the
                    entire decade. It tells the story of a real incident and it will send a shiver down your spine. The
                    show is about how enormous the damage really was, and how it influenced mankind everywhere. People
                    who lived to tell about never really recovered. The pilot episode of the show is one of the most
                    captivating episodes of all time.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> The show is pretty heavy though, and for good reason. It can get really rough at
                    times, to even imagine what those people actually went through. For some audience, it may be too
                    much to even watch. But it was important from the show's perspective to illustrate the real image of
                    the severity of the problem. But the show is really great, it has great actors, great background
                    score, great storytelling. Everything about the show is mind blowing.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">Chernobyl mini series is the perfect mix of entertainment, information, justice,
                    and tribute. It is one of those shows that you should absolutely watch and it will change the way
                    you look at media content. You would have a new found respect for the TV industry.

                    Both of these women are equally obsessed with each other and their characters are so well written,
                    that you would not know which one to root for. You probably would not have seen a cat and mouse game
                    quite like this one. The cast of the show is really fine, all of the actors are really skilled and
                    amazing.</p>
                <p class="post-text">It may seem to you like any other scripted and clicheÃÅd story, but that is so not
