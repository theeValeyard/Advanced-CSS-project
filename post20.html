                <p class="post-text">There is no better way to describe the northern lights than pure magic. Northern
                    lights are magical and
                    they are nothing less than something straight out of a fairytale. Although in the modern world, we
                    see
                    it as a scientific phenomenon, the charm of heavenly lights still remains. It's one of the most
                    beautiful
                    natural phenomena to exist on the planet.</p>
                <p class="post-text">It can't be explained over a blog post about how you are going to feel in the
                    presence of the northern lights. But it's certain that you won't regret it. There are many tourist
                    hotspots that you can visit for your utmost convenience. You can gaze upon the night sky in your
                    glass igloos while you tell the love of your life how much they mean to you. You can put your agony
                    and distress to rest, and you can begin life anew. You can change the course of generations and be
                    free. You just have to choose to do so. And if that is not reasons enough for you, here's another
                    list about why northern lights are magical and why you must visit them at least once before you die.

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">The legends and the lights</h2>


                <p class="post-text">There are countless legends about the colorful phenomena of the northern lights,
                    also known as Aurora Borealis. In North America, some people called them aqsarniit, which meant
                    football players. These people believed that the spirits of the dead playing football with the head
                    of a walrus. It was also believed that the aurora was a narrow and torch-lit pathway to guide
                    departed souls to heaven.</p>
                <p class="post-text">In Roman times, around the 16th century, Europe, people treated the red aurora as
                    frightening omens. A lot of really awe-striking stories have been woven around the mysterious
                    lights, some good, and some bad. Regardless, everyone thought they were the presence of the
                    supernatural right before their eyes.</p>
                <p class="post-text">If you dig a little deeper, there are hundreds of mythological stories and legends
                    about the northern lights or the aurora borealis. The lights have a special place in every section
                    of culture and history.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Histories and the mysteries</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Auroras have always been there. Through the ancient civilizations, a lot of
                    evidence is present on the existence of the lights. Galileo Galilei named the Northern Lights aurora
                    borealis, which means “the northern sunrise or the northern dawn". Northern lights are magical, that
                    is why they are a part of everyone's bucket list items, as it should be.</p>
                <p class="post-text">The lights move to the south when there is increased solar activity and sometimes
                    it can be noticed much further than the places they are usually observed at. It took a lot of people
                    a lot of time to figure out what it really was. But even if there is a scientific explanation for
                    its occurrence, you will forget that the second you set eyes on them. The way they make you feel is
                    so pure and magical, that you would want to lose yourself in the shadow of the night sky. </p>
                <p class="post-text"> The landscape covered in white snow, and the darkness set afire by love and
                    passion. You can for once feel the intensity of your emotions without holding back, because you will
                    be holding on to hope. And when you look hope in the face and choose to be strong, no force in the
                    world can stop you.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Voices of heaven</h2>

                <p class="post-text">
                    Some people say they can hear the northern lights. It has been reported that the aurora borealis
                    makes different kinds of sounds. Most of the time you won't be able to hear them. But if they're
                    close and you are away from the additional noise, you can hear them. Which is yet another reason why
                    you should witness the northern lights at least once in your lifetime.</p>
                <p class="post-text">You will never forget the way you felt sitting beneath that glorious show of
                    lights. It will stay with you until the day you die. And sitting out in the frozen cold, looking at
                    the sky, will definitely be worth it. </p>
                <p class="post-text">It makes you feel powerful and beautiful. Northern lights are magical and it will
                    align your heart and soul to the perfect harmony and the world will never be the same. Personally, I
                    believe that it's one of the most romantic things to ever exist. And I guarantee that the moment you
                    set your eyes to the flickering sky, you will fall in love with it too.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">The dazzling lights are the most peaceful and sight you will ever see, and that is
                    as close you can get to the occurrence of the supernatural. Those who don't believe in magic will
                    never find it. So, always question the possibility of things. The world will leave you amazed.

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Finding the Aurora Borealis</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Another thing to add up to its charm is that it is unpredictable. You can't predict
                    when the next show is going to be. And no two aurora Borealis are the same. Each show of the
                    northern lights is unique and breathtaking.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> The best views are seen on high northern latitudes during the winter, in places
                    like Fairbanks, Alaska; Dawson City, Yukon; Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada; Gillam,
                    Manitoba, Canada; the southern tip of Greenland; Reykjavik, Iceland; Tromsø, Norway; and the
                    northern coast of Siberia. So, there are a lot of places that you can go to. Aurora borealis can be
                    seen from the space, and you can find a rough estimation of the occurrence of a show if you do the
                    right research.</p>
                <p class="post-text">You may need to put in some extra effort to figure out and be in the right spot at
                    the right time, but it will be one of the best moments of your life and you should definitely invest
                    in that. Nature always finds a way to make to feel smaller. The feeling of being connected to
                    something bigger and being part of a bigger whole can be a life altering experience for you. Follow
                    your heart and it will take you to your destination. Northern lights are magical, and when you pick
                    a star on the dark horizon and follow it, you often find things that you wouldn't otherwise. So,
                    take a chance, and the leap of faith will be the savior you need. Believe me, when I say this, life
                    can be really beautiful if you have the courage to go look for beauty in the unknown places.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Cold fire</h2>

                <p class="post-text">The patterns look like fire in the sky, and the majestic aura is undeniably
                    precious. However, on the contrary, they are not hot. Aurora is not as close as they appear. The
                    truth is that they are really high in the sky and the temperatures that they exist in are really
                    low. So, they are known as the cold fire too.</p>
                <p class="post-text">If you can find clear skies and a quiet place, you can have a really good time. So,
                    if you have an option to drive to a place like that, you should do that. Also, don't forget your
                    camera. The highest lights are red in color and they are really hard for human eyes to capture
                    properly. But cameras can easily do the job. Besides, you would obviously want to remember such an
                    incredible experience. Photographs make these moments last forever, and one day you will be old, you
                    will have something to smile back to. </p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">To conclude</h2>

                <p class="post-text">The earth is a beautiful place, the possibility of your existence is a beauty in
                    itself. And life is a gift, and those who don't live die with regrets. Living won't be easy, it will
                    get dark sometimes, but the northern lights are magical, and still, they will shine. Nature never
                    fails to inspire. Nature will always put you back on your feet. So, don't give up and hold on for a
                    little longer. Things get better, you grow stronger and the sky feels like a home you never had.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> It will change your life in a way you can't fathom. Travel to the far side of the
                    world to look at the sky, and remember it for the rest of your life. Life is made of moments, and
                    these are the little pockets where you actually live.</p>
