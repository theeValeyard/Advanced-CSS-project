                    real thing, and its symptoms must never be ignored. But music can help a great deal with anxiety.

                    going right.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Listening to happy and uplifting music can save you from recurring bouts of
                    anxiety. Music can save a life, and lift the burden off your shoulders. Happiness is a choice, and

                <p class="post-text">It's scientifically proven that people who play any kind of instrument have
                    enhanced motor and reasoning skills. Research shows a visible correlation between learning to play
                    an instrument as a child and being successful later in the future. But something as simple as just
                    listening to music can also make you smarter and improve your memory.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> ave you ever wondered why it was comparatively easier to remember song lyrics than
                    anything else? That's because music sharpens your memory. So, if you are studying for a test, you
                    can put on some music without lyrics in it, to memorize it better. The lyrics can be confusing while
                    studying, so playing melody or calm music in the background can help you focus better. Later,
                    whatever you memorized with the tune in your head is much easier to recall than something memorized
                    without it. You can also use video game soundtracks for studying. That music is specifically
                    designed to keep you focused.

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Can shape your personality</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Music can play a major role in shaping your personality. The kind of music you like

                    different version of reality and in the real world, there is no equality. There is no single
                    standard to map that everyone is equal. There is no up or down, everyone just functions a different
                    way. Everyone is different and unique in their own way. Your music reflects your philosophies and
                    commitments that you carry in the world. And it becomes easier to find like-minded people through
                    your taste in music.</p>

                    universe has a tendency to fall in love with stubborn hearts.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Make you a better human being</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Music makes you a better human being on a lot of different grounds. It makes you
                    happy, and when you're happy, you want to make everyone around you happy. It makes you feel good, so
                    you want to make sure that everyone should have a good time. Also, it awakens that feeling of
                    compassion and empathy for others. You should be kind to people, whenever you are in a position to
                    help them.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">Everyone needs a little motivation, every now and then. Music can inspire you, to
                    take all those chances you were too scared to take. Always choose to heal, always choose to forgive.
                    And as the famous saying goes, the world breaks everyone, some of us are just stronger in the broken
                    places.</p>
                <p class="post-text">To conclude, music can help you through the rough times in your life. There will
                    always be times when you will feel defeated and tired, but it will always be your decision if you
                    want to stay that way or change for the better. So, next time, turn your music loud, and dance with
                    it until you feel good again. You can harness the power and positivity of music to stand back up on
                    your feet.</p>

                <p class="post-text">Let it be the light at the end of the tunnel. Choose to be brave in the face of
                    life. And choose to be happy. As long as you're happy, know that you won life. If you truly
                    understand that one small fact, you can play death on the strings of life the way Orpheus did. Lose
                    yourself in the music, and you will find yourself in the process.</p>
