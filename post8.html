                <p class="post-text">Bathing a dog can be a nightmare, and if you have tried bathing a dog, you know
                    exactly what I'm talking about. But luckily, there are a few things that you can do to make the
                    process a little easier for you and your pet. Here are a few things that you can do to not be a
                    soaking mess by the time you’re done. So, let’s wash that dirty dog, shall we?</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Make the dog comfortable</h2>

                <p class="post-text">For the most part, animals are not very fond of bathing. So, you want to make sure
                    that they are
                    not stressed out or anxious. You want them calm and comfortable. Play with your dog for a while
                    before you bathe it. Pet it and make it feel relaxed and happy. It will help them get rid of some of
                    that energy and help you have a better time cleaning them.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Prepare for the bath</h2>

                <p class="post-text">The noises in the bathroom can scare your pet, you want to do the preparation way
                    before your
                    dog even realizes that there is going to be a bath. There is a good chance that you already know
                    this stuff if you live with a dog, but we still hope you learn a little something here today. Here
                    are some of the things that you need to keep in mind</p>
                <ol class="post-text">
                    <li>If you’re using a bathtub, pre-fill the bathtub around 6 to 8 inches before you bring your pet.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make sure the water is lukewarm, you don’t want it to be too hot or too cold. If you use water
                        that is too hot, it will make your pet’s coat dry and itchy as it washes away the important
                        oils. Dog’s bodies don’t produce oil the same way our bodies do. Cold water can make your dog
                        really uncomfortable. So, make sure you use lukewarm water that’s
                        not harsh on your dog’s skin.</li>
                    <li>Another reason why dogs hate bathing is lack of proper grip. They keep slipping on the
                        wet surface and it makes them more and more anxious. You should really invest in no- slip mats
                        for dogs. These are rubber mats that you place in your bathtub while bathing your dog so the
                        paws don’t slip and it is not constantly trying to jump out and splashing you wet. It is highly
                        recommended and it really helps. However, if you don’t have one at hand, throw a few towels in
                        the bathtub so your dog doesn’t slip. You want your dog to be calm and still.</li>
                    <li>Use a mild shampoo. It is best if you use products specifically made for dogs or something
                        prescribed by your vet, but if you don't have that at hand for some reason, make sure the
                        shampoo is mild. You can also use baby shampoo if you don’t have dog shampoo at hand.</li>
                    <li>Use a hand shower and start from the back. Don’t be hasty, you want to be calm about it. And
                        never splash water directly in your dog’s face. It makes them feel like they are drowning and
                        you don’t want them to feel like that.</li>
                    <li>You can use a damp cloth to clean the face and ears. And do this after you’ve cleaned the rest
                        of the body.</li>
                    <li>Always have treats ready to keep your dog motivated. And make sure you keep the leash on while
                        you bathe it. You want to be able to control it while you bathe it. Or be prepared to eat soap.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="post-text">After you have considered all these things and prepared for them, now is the time
                    to bring your dog to the bathroom.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Keeping the dog under control</h2>


                <p class="post-text">You don’t want to scare the dog but you don’t want it to be over the top excited
                    either. The result
                    is exactly the same. Having the leash on helps you control your dog if it tries to run out. Start
                    with the back and keep petting the dog. You don’t actually need any fancy brushes or anything but if
                    you prefer to use them, that’s your wish. But using your hand will make them more relaxed. Apply the
                    shampoo and massage gently. Clean everything and take your time.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">Keep talking to your dog while you bathe it. And keep one hand on your dog at all
                    times. It makes your dog more comfortable, and more importantly, one hand on the head prevents it
                    from shaking the water off and soaking you in it. Apply gentle pressure to keep it under control.
                    Another good thing is, regular peanut butter is safe for your dogs to consume. So, take a small
                    amount of peanut butter and stick it to the wall of the bathtub. It will keep your dog busy and it
                    won’t move a lot when you’re bathing it. Dogs love peanut butter, and you can use it on multiple
                    occasions, like cutting their nails, grooming them, etc.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">After the bath</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Make sure that you dry your dog completely after the bath. Especially in winters.
                    Put some dry
                    towels on the floor so your dog’s paws don’t slip when it comes out of the water. Wipe it dry with
                    towels. You can use a blow dryer on the lowest heat if your dog does not get scared of it. And
                    really make sure that you dry their ears completely. Even if they resist. Blow-dry their ears in
                    winters. Dogs' ears are prone to infection and need special attention.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> Congratulations, the dirty dog now smells like flowers. Although, you shouldn’t
                    wash your dog too frequently. Dogs' bodies don’t replenish the oils the same way human bodies do,
                    so, it can ruin their coat. It might irritate their skin and make it dry and roughen the fur. It is
                    recommended that you bathe your puppy once every season. But most dogs tend to get dirty and need to
                    be cleaned more frequently than that. If your dog starts to smell or gets too dirty, you obviously
                    need to bathe it. The point is, don’t do it too often.
                    Good luck!</p>
