                <p class="post-text">Having a pet is signing up for a lot of work, and I mean a lot. It’s almost like
                    raising a child, and
                    it’s not an easy job. So, you should consider everything before you get a pet. But that’s past tense
                    because if you’re reading this right now, you already got one. And exercising for your dog is very
                    important. Your dog needs to exercise every single day of the week. And a dog who is tired at the
                    end of the day is a dog that had fun that day.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">But it’s not always as simple as that. We all live in different areas of the world
                    where there are days and circumstances where it is not possible to exercise our woofs outside in the
                    sunshine. Doesn’t matter which corner of the world you live in, there will be days which will be too
                    hot or too cold or too rainy to take your dog outside. Even nowadays, a lot of people are strictly
                    locked in their houses due to coronavirus. Situations like this arise all the time when you are
                    required to stay indoors. So, what should you do in a situation like this? The answer is, you get
                    creative. And here is how you do that.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Hide treats throughout the house</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Hiding treats throughout the house can be a fun treasure hunt for your dog. It
                    requires them to use their intelligence as well as their body. Don’t go too extreme with this, you
                    don’t want them to destroy your stuff. What you can do is, lock them in the bathroom for a while and
                    hide their favorite treats throughout the house where you think they can probably reach if they used
                    some of their tiny heads. The moment they come out of the bathroom and pick up the scent, then your
                    job is to pretty much admire how cute they are trying to figure it out. You can also do your work,
                    after setting this up for your dogs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Tricks and basic commands</h2>

                <p class="post-text">If you teach your dog to follow your basic commands, it can get easier for you to
                    control it at times. If you use treats to motivate them, trust me, they won’t have a problem doing
                    it all day. You can entertain and feed them at the same time, which is pretty great. It is not the
                    only option you have, you can also excite them with playing or their favorite toy. But for the most
                    part, they don’t get bored with treats for a long time. Although, you don’t want to overdo it. Too
                    many treats are not good for your pet either.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Stairs</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Most of us have access to stairs in our houses or apartment buildings. You can take
                    the dog up and down on the stairs for a good cardio exercise. Make sure you have the lease on. It
                    gives you more control over your dog and helps you and your dog avoid any possible injury. Even
                    though it sounds a little ironic, but even with four legs, they are clumsy as hell.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Use a treadmill</h2>

                <p class="post-text">If you have a treadmill, that can help you and your dog get some good exercise. If
                    you live in extreme climates, it is recommended that you invest in a treadmill for both you and your
                    dog. When you are exercising your dog, make sure that the dog is not scared of the machine. You want
                    it to be comfortable around it and you want to supervise at all times. Never leave your dog alone
                    with the treadmill on, and never tie the lease directly to the treadmill. It is a good idea to have
                    the lease on though, but you want to hold on to it instead. And keep motivating your dog to
                    exercise.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Play tug</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Dogs love to play tug, with literally anything that they can get their jaws on. So,
                    it’s wise to invest in a tug toy or make a tug out of a worn-out rug or something. Otherwise, they
                    can destroy your clothes and things while trying to play. The tug is a great way for you and your
                    dog to exercise at the same time. You want to do it on a carpet though. The floor of your apartment
                    is hard and not fit for your dog to play on, or at least, play as aggressively as on a tug. Your dog
                    must have a firm grip to maintain the balance and avoid any chance of potential injury. It will
                    leave both of you out of breath soon enough.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Turn on TV if you need to leave</h2>

                <p class="post-text">If you need to leave for some work or just need to leave your dog alone in general,
                    leave the TV and the fan or the heater on. They are happy to indulge themselves in any animal
                    channel. It is not exactly a physical exercise, it’s more like keeping your pet occupied with
                    something so they don’t wreck the house. House pets often entertain themselves with sounds coming
                    from outside, so the TV can be a good idea. Besides, if they can have something to bark with or
                    something to bark at while you’re not around, it’s a win-win for everyone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Conclusion</h2>

                <p class="post-text">When it comes to exercise, the outdoors are the best. They make your dog feel novel
                    as opposed to being home all day. It’s a play date and an adventure. But because it may be hard to
                    access them sometimes, you still want to exercise your pets. You should also give them massages
                    after a long day of play if they are really tired. They get sore muscles too.
                    Just be creative, there are no hard and fast rules to go about this. Do what feels best and what’s
                    the most fun. Just make sure that it is safe for everyone. I hope you have a great time with your
                    woofs.
                    Stay healthy, stay safe.</p>
