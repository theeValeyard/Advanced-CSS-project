                <p class="post-text">Art is much more than what meets the eye. The value of art has more to do with
                    perception. Art has no
                    boundaries, art has no rules, art doesn't dictate what art should be. But it is a billion-dollar
                    industry at
                    the same time. Being an artist comes with a lot of challenges, and appreciation of art is an art in
                    itself.
                    But it still triggers the mind, how something that looks like it's painted by a little child is
                    worth millions
                    of dollars. And what makes it more expensive than the next piece.</p>
                <p class="post-text">There are many angles to look at it, and if you're wondering how one can determine
                    the actual value of art, or what makes it unbelievably expensive or worth nothing at all, this
                    article is for you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">It's hard to put a value on art</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Art is an independent discipline, so it's hard to put a value on art. However,
                    there are some technical aspects that you can consider while evaluating it, like the size, how old
                    is it, who made it, if it has been bought by someone before and the like. The value of art is
                    determined by the perceiver. Something can be worth millions to a person and worth nothing at all to
                    the next. If you connect to a piece of art, it is valuable for you, if you don't, it's simply not.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">But that's not the way you should be looking at art. Unless you plan to buy a piece
                    of art at a given time, you should never see it for it is worth economically. Art needs to be
                    appreciated and admired. The market value of a piece of art keeps changing. In the end, the value of
                    something is only going to be what people are willing to pay. And art should not be bound in terms
                    of money.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Artist's perception of the art</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Artists don't think of money when it comes to their craft. It's more of a
                    reflection of themselves into the big wide world, and money is just a tiny aspect of it. Artists
                    tell their story through art and to them the value of art lies in, how many people were able to
                    connect to it. Art is not about beauty, it never was. It means different things to different people,
                    its strength lies in the uniqueness, the raw passion, and the ability to convey those intense
                    emotions. It will be beautiful to some, and it will be stupid to others. So, it depends on you if
                    you were able to connect to something or not.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Artists often live a challenging life. It's not easy to sustain yourself being an
                    artist. Because again, the value of something is only going to be what people are willing to pay for
                    it at the end of the day. So, next time you look at a piece of art, make sure you encourage the
                    artist. A tiny thing like that can make a huge difference to that person.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Simple curve of supply and demand</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Whenever the demand for something increases, the supply has to catch up to satisfy
                    the people. But when the supply is less, and the demand is immense, the thing becomes exclusive. The
                    reason why some paintings are so expensive is because the artists who painted them are no longer
                    alive anymore. The value of art increases significantly after the artist is dead. Because it makes
                    that piece exclusive and more important. Most of the famous art by eminent artists are preserved in
                    museums. That is why even if a painting looks like a toddler splashed paint on a canvas is worth
                    millions sometimes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Heavy cost of exhibitions and art galleries
                </h2>

                <p class="post-text">It is not just the value of art that needs to be considered while evaluating it.
                    Exhibitions and events are expensive. If you really want your art to be seen in the elite art
                    galleries on the planet, that is going to cost you a buck. Being a member of an elite art club can
                    be super expensive. So, even if you are someone who appreciates art, you won't be able to afford it.
                    Art exhibitions, auctions, and other events cost money. To bring the art in front of people and
                    making them aware of its existence is not cheap. So, it is another factor why some of the pieces of
                    art are worth so much.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Rise of abstract art and modern art</h2>

                <p class="post-text">The invention of camera technology led to a major shift in the art culture. Now,
                    the camera could do a much better job at what art had been doing for years. So, art was no longer
                    about representing the world with skill. The modern art was more focused on the abstract aspect. It
                    was more about the feeling and representing yourself rather than the world. So, that was one of the
                    huge shifts in the art culture and that definitely affected the way it is perceived by the world
                    today.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Art is seen as an easy investment</h2>

                <p class="post-text">
                    Art is seen as an easy investment and wealthy people often use it for selfish means and not exactly
                    for the purpose that it is meant for. The value of art keeps changing, and if you bought something
                    for a million dollars today, the value of that piece would be much more than that in the next seven
                    years. The elite class of the society uses art to avoid taxes and boost their image.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> Think of it like this, you bought something for a million dollars and it is worth
                    10 million dollars after ten years, and you have an annual income of 20 million dollars. Now, you
                    decide to donate your painting that is worth 10 million dollars, you only have to pay taxes for the
                    remaining 10 million. And your huge charity will be reported and circulated around the world. On top
                    of everything, your name will be mentioned beside the painting you donated where it is kept in a
                    museum. So, it is a powerful way to manipulate and use art to your advantage.</p>
                <p class="post-text">It is not a particularly bad thing, but art should be seen as more than the dollar
                    value of it. It should be seen for it was created for and what the artist wanted to convey, or what
                    it means to you. Art is a tricky thing to judge, but those who live for it know, how wonderfully
                    amazing it can be and how without it, the world will turn to grey.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Practicing art is expensive</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Practicing art is not cheap. Artists often live hard lives. It's not easy to get by
                    and local artists find it really hard to sell their stuff. The difference is almost groundbreaking.
                    Either artists are crazy rich or barely getting by. But that's the beauty of it. Artists still stick
                    to their craft even after being broke. The way they perceive reality, the way they see the world
                    that hasn't been so kind to them, and the will to stand up and face it every single day is easier
                    said than done.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">
                    Art is liberation, and it requires sacrifice and courage that very few possess. A struggling artist
                    is a warrior within, fighting countless battles in the mind and the world alike. So, next time you
                    see one, be thoughtful and compassionate. The life they choose to live is out on the edge, where it
                    is beautiful and deadly at the same time. Like when the sun goes down, half in the shadows, half
                    burned in flames.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">In conclusion</h2>

                <p class="post-text">All art is precious, all art is unique in its own way. Art is powerful and
                    magnificent. No wonder some of it mad expensive. It lives to tell the tale of the artist. And that
                    tale is what immortalizes the artist, well after his death. It is the beauty of it, that the reality
                    may change, the moment or feeling captured will not. It is a sacred profession, it is the only thing
                    that can truly set you free, so, let it.</p>
