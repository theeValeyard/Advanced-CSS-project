                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Isle of the Skye</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Isle of the Skye is one of the most perfect places on earth. It is surrounded by
                    deep green valleys, lonely glens, mesmerizing skies, and romantic mountains. It makes you feel
                    connected to nature and wildlife, and it has really gorgeous waterfalls. The edge of the world makes
                    you feel so special and beautiful, that at that moment, you're actually free as a bird. The winds
                    make you feel strong and weak at the same time, one of the precious moments when you feel courage
                    and fear simultaneously.</p>
                <p class="post-text">If you ever go to the Skye, make sure you don't miss the fairy pools. They are
                    located near the village of Carbost and they are a perfect place for photographers, walkers, and
                    adventurous swimmers. You won't believe your eyes the first time you see them, it's something
                    literally out of a fairytale.
                </p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Isle of Arran</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Isle of Arran is like the miniature version of Scotland. It mirrors the entire
                    Scotland in a very small place, and the best part is, you can take a ferry from Glasgow and reach
                    there in less than an hour.</p>
                <p class="post-text">You should really consider staying for a few days to explore this sampler for the
                    rich Scottish vibe. The food is really great and it has a really dramatic coastline that you can
                    admire for hours. The walkways and feel of the place is almost intoxicating. Feeling good is really
                    important for a fulfilled life, and travel makes you feel good. The scenery and the charm of
                    Scotland will melt your heart.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">The northern highlands</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Every single place in Scotland is so picturesque and beautiful that you won't be
                    able to decide which one is better. The way northern highlands change color through the seasons
                    makes them look almost too good to be true. The wildlife, greenery and scenic mountains will keep
                    you coming for more.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> If you like trekking, it can be a really memorable trip for you and your loved
                    ones. Check for the weather conditions though, weather can take a toll on you. It rains quite often,
                    so if you're not prepared or not able to manage during the trek, you can get sick and it can be
                    pretty difficult to handle the situation. Also, speaking of rain, you shouldn't cancel your plans
                    due to rain or wait for it to stop, Scotland is famous for its changing weather and rain. You can
                    still have a great time though, you just need a little more determination.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Edinburgh Castle</h2>

                <p class="post-text">
                    Scotland has way over 2000 castles, and a lot of them are beautiful pieces of architecture. But
                    Edinburgh Castle definitely stands out. The skyline of Edinburgh isn't complete without the
                    silhouette of the mighty castle.</p>
                <p class="post-text">The royal mile below stretches elegantly and you can still feel the charm of the
                    capital city to this day. The castle hill looks like a crown and is one of the top paid tourist
                    attractions of the city. And it is definitely worth checking out. Travel doesn't only takes you to
                    different places, it also takes you back in time. Travel makes you feel good about all the things
                    that you get to feel in life. It is a perfect example of investing in experiences and not
                    materialistic things.

                <p class="post-text">The legend of Loch Ness or the Nessie made this place even better for a must-visit.
                    Nessie was considered to be a vicious monster in the waters of Loch Ness which got international
                    attention in 1993. There are many interesting stories and folk tales about the existence of it, but
                    it's definitely something that you should experience first hand.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> The location is really good and the water gives the entire landscape a mirror
                    feel. Which makes it look and feel even more mystical and supernatural. You seriously don't want to
                    miss out on this one.</p>
            </div>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Loch Lomond</h2>

                    memories of your life.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Highland Folk Museum in Newtonmore</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Newtonmore is Britain's first mainland open-air museum. It gives you the exact vibe
                    of how people lived in the highlands in the older days. It gives you a good idea of what they ate,
                    what they wore, how they lived and the related things. It's innovative and relaxing. There are no
                    charges for entry into the museum and you won't regret it. Places like this make you feel how
                    traveling is the best form of pilgrimage. Travel makes you feel good and pure, and it's a way to
                    keep our childish curiosity that society forces us to give up on. </p>

            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Conclusion</h2>

                <p class="post-text">One thing is for sure, Scotland will leave you amazed. And at the end of the day,
                    your heart and mind will be at peace. In the modern world we live in, the quality of life has
                    significantly changed. Luxury no longer means a good house, a good car and a stable and risk free
                    life. Even if we wanted to follow that model, we can't because of the rocketing cost of education,
                    health care, and housing. And one of the proud factors of our generation is, we tend to be more
                    spiritual than materialistic.</p>
                <p class="post-text">So, for a lot of young minds, luxury means, the ability to work from everywhere
                    (freedom of place), the ability to work at the desired time (freedom of time), and the ability to
                    financially sustain themselves ( freedom of money). And travel is not as expensive or as scary as it
                    looks. Millennials prefer to invest in experiences than things. And it is a great way to look at
                    life because nothing lasts forever. Life doesn't need to be long, life needs to be lived.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Everyone should keep traveling because when you travel, you learn from life itself.
                    Travel makes you feel good and enchanted because your soul loves to keep learning new things. If you
                    approach life from a student's perspective, you can never fail. On a long enough timeline, you will
                    succeed.
