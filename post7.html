                <p class="post-text">Dogs are considered man’s best friends, and for good reason. They complete your
                    life in a way that nothing else can. So, let’s learn how to welcome these fur angels into our world
                    and how to care for them in the first few weeks of their life. It can be intimidating at times, but
                    soon enough, they will turn into playful bundles of joy and all your efforts will be worth it.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Taking care of any newborn animal is a responsible task and you want to be prepared
                    for it. For the first week, they are most vulnerable and require the most attention and care. If the
                    mother is present to take care of the puppy, it is the best case scenario and you should just leave
                    it alone for the most part. She takes care of almost all the puppy's needs. You still need to take
                    care of their hygiene and keep the mother and the puppies warm, but you won’t need to handle the
                    puppies a lot. Make sure you provide a clean, safe, and warm environment and avoid any contact with
                    any other animals. But if the mother is not well enough to take care of the pups, you need to nurse
                    them yourself.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Taking care of a newborn puppy without a mother</h2>


                <p class="post-text"> The first week is the most critical. Newborn puppies need to be well fed and you
                    need to nurse them every 2 hours. Don’t feed cow milk or regular milk to a newborn puppy, they can’t
                    digest it and it might make them sick. Use a canine milk replacer to supplement and feed them every
                    2 hours. Use a syringe to feed them (you can later shift to a tube as they grow older). And make
                    sure that all the paws are on the floor or your lap while feeding them, don’t feed them the way you
                    would feed a human baby. It can result in filling their lungs and it can be really dangerous.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Take extra care of the temperature. Most of the young puppies and kittens don’t
                    make it due to a lack of proper warmth. If you are using a heating pad that turns off on its own
                    after a while, you will be putting them in potential danger if you don't check up on regular
                    intervals. You need to make sure that they are warm at all times. Newborn puppies or kittens can’t
                    self thermoregulate, that’s why heat is one of the major concerns. You can also use a rice sock to
                    keep them warm, it retains heat for a long period of time. Also, make sure that if you’re using a
                    heating pad, it should not be too hot. Newborn puppies need to be handled very gently.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Newborn puppies can’t use the bathroom on their own. The mother usually licks them
                    to stimulate them to urinate or go potty. If the mother is not around, you need to do that. Use a
                    soft tissue or a baby wipe to assist them in going to the bathroom every two hours.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> Young puppies need a lot of affection, and in the absence of their mother, you
                    should weigh them daily and make sure there is steady weight gain. Show affection to make sure that
                    they are not stressed.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Newborn puppies need a lot of sleep, they will be sleeping for the most part,
                    waking up only to eat or use the bathroom.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Consult a vet early on, especially if you are doing it for the first time. Make
                    sure you are doing everything under proper medical guidance. If the puppies are healthy, you should
                    wait for about 6 weeks before bringing them to the vet for a checkup. But if you feel like something
                    is wrong, immediately call the vet.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Here are some of the things that you should be on a lookout
                    for:</h2>
                <ol class="post-text">
                    <li>Constant crying</li>
                    <li>Pale gums</li>
                    <li>Breathing difficulty</li>
                    <li>Coughing/ wheezing</li>
                    <li>Diarrhea</li>
                    <li>Vomiting</li>
                    <li>Poor weight gain</li>
                    <li>Lack of apatite</li>
                    <li>Any strange discharge from the mouth or eyes</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="post-text">If you notice anything like that, consult a doctor immediately. Newborn puppies are
                    susceptible to disease, especially in the absence of the mother. </p>

                <p class="post-text">Consider consulting an animal shelter in your locality. You can find volunteers
                    with experience in helping you take care of the puppy. And it significantly increases the chances of
                    the puppy’s survival. They can also assist you to properly take care of the puppy. </p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Conclusion</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Any newborn animal needs proper caring and you need to devote your day and night
                    into doing that. The first few weeks are the hardest as the newborns are at their most vulnerable
                    stage and require all your effort and attention. But that is a special experience in itself. Not to
                    mention how ridiculously cute they are. However, you do not want to do something like this
                    unprepared. Make sure you are properly equipped to handle any situation that arises. Their life is
                    quite literally in your hands, so you need to be really careful.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> I hope that you are able to save some lives.</p>
