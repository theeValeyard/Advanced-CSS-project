                <p class="post-text">It can be terrifying to see your dog sick and sad. But as a dog owner, you will

                    these rough times.</p>
                <p class="post-text">
                    Here is how you can be there for your dog, the way it has always been there for you. Let’s see how
                    you can lift your dog’s spirits through these trying times.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Recognize that your pet is sick</h2>

                <p class="post-text">When you can physically see the sickness, it has obviously grown a lot. But there
                    may be some warning signs that you may have missed. Here are some of the things you want to be on a
                    lookout for: </p>
                <ol class="post-text">
                    <li>Pale gums – Pale gums can be a sign of a lot of health problems. Check the color of your pet’s
                        gum when it is healthy, so it is easier for you to differentiate. If you see any kind of unusual
                        pigmentation, call your vet to be sure.</li>
                    <li>Labored breathing – Labored breathing is a sign of discomfort in both humans and animals. If you
                        see your pet breathing through the mouth without panting, or see it breathe in an unusual manner
                        for a long time, call your vet.</li>
                    <li>Inactivity / Lethargy – If you see your dog not taking part in activities that usually interest
                        it, then it may be a warning sign. It can also mean that your dog is just lazy. But if your dog
                        shows signs of lethargy for more than 24 hours, call your vet.</li>
                    <li>Temperature – Dog’s bodies are naturally a bit warmer. But if you find the temperature below 99
                        degrees or over 104 degrees, immediately call your doctor.</li>
                    <li>Loss of apatite – Dogs can lose apatite when they are sick, just like humans. But again, it
                        could also mean that they are just not hungry at the time. If they don’t eat properly for a long
                        time, it can be something serious and you should consult an expert.</li>
                    <li>Excessive salivation – Excessive salivation can be a sign of discomfort for your pet. It can be
                        seen in the case of excessive heat, if heat exhaustion is the case, get your dog in a cool place
                        as soon as possible and give cold water.</li>
                    <li>Urinating more – If your dog is urinating more than usual, or has peed all over the house, it
                        can be a sign. Monitor the urine and the stool to check if they have eaten something bad. Keep
                        an eye out for discolored urine.</li>
                    <li>Vomiting/ diarrhea – If your dog is throwing up all over the place, it is obvious that it is not
                        in very good shape. If your dog is whining a lot, don’t ignore it either. If your dog has
                        difficulty walking, call your vet as soon as possible.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Call the vet as soon as possible</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Don’t try to take matters into your own hands, the experts are experts for a
                    reason. You can end up making the situation worse by yourself. You need to consult a professional as
                    soon as you can. Don’t try to be a know it all, when you don’t know it all. Even if it is nothing
                    serious, there is no harm in being sure. Don’t put your dog’s health at stake.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">If your dog is sick</h2>

                <p class="post-text">If your dog is sick, make sure that it has access to clean water, unless prescribed
                    otherwise by your doctor. In the case of vomiting, your vet may ask you to withhold food. It can be
                    a hard thing to process, thinking you are starving your dog when it is sick. But if your dog is
                    older than 6 months, and has been previously healthy, you can withhold food for up to 24 hours,
                    don’t get emotional here. The doctor knows what he is doing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">What to feed him</h2>

                <p class="post-text">The diet depends on the condition your dog is in, and your vet will give you the
                    proper details. But there are a few basic things like, under usual circumstances, if your dog has a
                    cold, don’t feed it curd. Give a bland diet for a few days if it has been throwing up a lot lately.
                    A bland diet has one part easy to digest protein and two parts easy to digest starch. Monitor your
                    dog’s symptoms closely.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Proper rest</h2>

                <p class="post-text">If your dog is sick, you have to make sure that they get a lot of rest. They may
                    feel like they are ready to play and run around again, but you should limit their playtime and
                    exercise to make sure they get proper sleep and rest. They need to recover. You can cuddle with your
                    dog if it likes it or is comfortable with it. You want to make sure that they are as comfortable as
                    they can get. Give them a lot of attention and make them feel loved.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Conclusion</h2>

                <p class="post-text">I hope you don’t get into a situation like this at all, and even if you do, we hope
                    your pet recovers soon. It can be hard for both of you. Work towards a better lifestyle for both
                    you, so you stay healthy anyway. Little things can have a major impact on your life. Also, if you
                    are sick, your pet is not going to have a good time either. Take care of your own and your pet’s
                    health. Because trust me, it can be really hard and expensive to buy your health back, and
                    sometimes, nothing is enough. Don’t wait for life to happen to you, and be prepared.
                    Stay healthy and safe!</p>
