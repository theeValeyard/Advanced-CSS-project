                <p class="post-text">Everyone wants a pet, but they don’t realize how much time, effort, and energy go
                    into keeping
                    them. It’s not as easy as it looks. So, if you are considering getting a pet, make sure you know
                    what you’re getting yourself into. Otherwise, the poor animal will suffer and so will you. But
                    having a pet is like having someone who helps you notice a rainbow in the darkest of days. So,
                    they are worth going the extra mile for, that’s for sure. If you don’t have much experience with
                    living with a pet, here are a few key things that you should keep in mind.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Vaccination</h2>

                <p class="post-text">If you decide to keep an animal in your house with you, make sure it is safe for
                    both of you.
                    Consult your vet and complete your pet’s vaccination as recommended by your vet. Before your
                    dog is completely vaccinated, don’t let it play or get in contact with other stray dogs or animals
                    which may or may not be vaccinated. It keeps you and your dog at potential risk of catching
                    something nasty.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> Even after the vaccination is complete, make sure you clean everything after your
                    dog comes in
                    contact with anything that might infect it or you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">The environment</h2>

                <p class="post-text">You want your pet to be in a clean and safe environment. At the end of the day,
                    they are still
                    animals, so you need to take care of their hygiene, food, safety, and everything. Your work will
                    almost double when it comes to cleanliness. So, make sure you’re prepared for cleaning all the
                    fur and mess. And you need to pay extra attention to make sure that none of you get sick. You
                    can invest in some gadgets like a pet hair vacuum cleaner to make your job comparatively
                    easier, but you have to know that hygiene is important. Remove everything that they can reach
                    and harm themselves with, anything sharp, anything small. It’s almost like having a toddler, but
                    this one almost never learns.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Grooming</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Your pet needs grooming, and that’s a fact. Depending upon the breed and the kind
                    of pet you
                    have, these things will vary a little, but grooming your pet is important. Make sure that you give
                    regular baths to your dog (you don’t need to bathe them too frequently, but consult your vet
                    anyway), get their nails clipped from time to time (it will get painful for you when they try to
                    play
                    if their nails are too long and they might damage furniture and other things in the house). Don’t
                    do it yourself if you don’t know how to do it. You can easily end up cutting the quick (also known
                    as quicking). Basically, you will end up cutting too much and your dog will end up bleeding too
                    much and it can take a long time for a nail quick to heal. Not to mention, it is extremely painful
                    for your dog and they tend to remember it for a long time.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> If you don’t know how to do it, just take it to your vet and he or she will do it
                    for you. If your dog
                    plays outside regularly, the nails will naturally grind to some extent. But if your pet is more like
                    a
                    house pet, you need to clip their nails regularly. And if your pet has a lot of furs, you will need
                    to
                    spend a lot on their hair products and haircuts too.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Food and Water</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Providing good food is obviously a necessity. Your pet’s health depends a lot on
                    its diet. And if
                    you need to leave your pet alone for long durations, like when you go to work, make sure that it
                    has access to clean drinking water and food. Invest in some good quality pet food and don’t
                    forget to brush their teeth. Dental care is really important too. You can get them calcium chew
                    toys to keep them busy and exercising their gums simultaneously. You can get a toothbrush that
                    works like a chew toy, to keep your pet excited and healthy at the same time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Play and exercise</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Exercise and playing are really important for every animal, including humans. If
                    your pet is more
                    of a house pet, you need to give it even more attention. Exercise keeps your pets healthy and fit
                    and it also gives you a reason to exercise with them. Don’t forget to take your pets on long
                    walks and playdates. If you can’t do it yourself because of a busy schedule, hire someone to do
                    it for you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Regular veterinarian visits</h2>

                <p class="post-text">You should visit your vet regularly to make sure everything is okay. Even if there
                    is any kind of
                    risk, it is better to know as early as possible. If you find anything unusual with your dog, call
                    the
                    vet to be sure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Training and relationships</h2>

                <p class="post-text">If you decide to keep a pet, and especially a big and aggressive pet, training is a
                    must. You
                    need to be able to communicate with your pet at all times. Having a strong relationship with your
                    pet can make both of you feel fulfilled. If you don’t know how to train your dog or don’t have the
                    time to train it yourself, hire someone to do it for you. Remember, at the end of the day, you
                    want to be able to trust your pet completely, and your pet can trust you completely. Help your
                    dog socialize with others, whenever you have time. You want your pet to be comfortable around
                    other people as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Don’t let your pet roam unsupervised at all</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Even if your dog is no longer a pup, you should still never let it roam
                    unsupervised. At the end of
                    the day, it is still an animal. It can get run over by a vehicle or get in contact with something
                    toxic, maybe even eat it, and you won’t have the slightest idea. And it can scare other people as
                    well, who don’t know it as well as you do. Even if your pet is friendly, there is always a chance of
                    someone abducting it. You want to treat your pet like a toddler because honestly, that’s how
                    smart they are. They can either be a really angry toddler or a really innocent one, either way,
                    you don’t them unsupervised.</p>
