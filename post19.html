        <p class="post-text">Wanna get started with affiliate marketing? You’ve come to the right place. The amount of information out there can leave you confused and wanting to pull your hair out, it’s called information overload. We’ve all been there. But now you easily get started with affiliate marketing by only focusing on the information that’s important. It’s easier than you might think. Let us help you take that leap of faith!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col my-4">
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">What is affiliate marketing?</h2>

        <p class="post-text">In simplest words, affiliate marketing is when you promote someone else’s product or service and when someone buys that product or service, you get paid in commission. You can promote any product of your choice and get paid. Affiliate marketing is one of the best ways to generate income online. Your job is to target the interested audience and promote the commodity. Basically, you hype people up for something and if they make a purchase, they buy directly from the creator and you get paid in whatever commission that you’ve both agreed upon. Earning up to 50% commission is pretty normal and you can do that fairly easily.</p> 
        <p class="post-text"> There are a lot of affiliate programs on the internet, almost all big brands and companies have affiliate programs that you can join for free. They give you a certain link, through which you will be promoting a service or a product and if you manage to make any sales, you get paid accordingly. The best part is, you don’t need to have your own product, you don’t need to be an expert, anyone can do it. You just send the quality traffic to someone else’s product or service and they pay you for the leads you bring in. Let’s dive a bit deeper into the specifications.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col my-4">
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">How to get started with affiliate marketing?</h2>

        <p class="post-text">There are many ways that you can get started with affiliate marketing. You just need to promote stuff, the medium you choose to do that is totally up to you. You can do it by social media, emails, even through paid promotion. The thing is, affiliate marketing is not as easy as it sounds. ‘cause it works on the ‘take my word for it’ philosophy. So, to be able to do that right, you need a good audience base. You need to be able to generate good quality traffic because if you can’t, you won’t be able to convert them to generate sales, thus, not making any money.</p> 
    </div>

    <div class="col my-4">
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Building an Email list (Most Important)</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Having an email list is probably the most important part of having an affiliate business. It allows you to retarget your potential customers and resell to them, gradually building you a loyal customer base.</p> 
        <p class="post-text">In simple words, email marketing is capturing leads in the form of emails and when you have a product or service to sell, you follow up to them with a sales pitch.</p>
        <p class="post-text">You can buy a premade email list, but it’s always best to build your own. A good way to get people’s email is to provide them with something of value for free in exchange for their email addresses. Stay in touch with them, send them valuable free stuff and build trust before you throw a product their way. Because if you do, they are most likely to not buy. Your potential customers must always, like you, know who you are, and must trust you. If you don’t have the above three, you won’t be generating any sales. If someone is going to buy something from you, you need to give them a good reason why they should.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="col my-4">
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Creating an affiliate Website</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Another way to go about this is by having an affiliate website. You can do a lot of things to earn from a website. A website gives you the freedom to monetize it in multiple ways, hence, generating multiple streams of income. Being an affiliate, you can build your audience on your website, and promote services and products via that. Also, you can monetize your website with a good ad network to earn a little extra. If you have a good audience base, you can earn quite a bit of money through ads.</p> 
        <p class="post-text">You can also capture emails through your website to build your list (it is always a good idea to do that). You can give affiliate links to products and services that you’re promoting in the content that you’re creating. This is long term, and if you have a loyal consumer base, it can help you create your own personal products. And it can absolutely give you financial freedom if you do it right.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col my-4">
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Opt-ins (Landing pages)</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Opt-in pages are landing pages that are used to capture email addresses. Landing pages are the pages where your traffic is going to land, and it is where you capture their emails. And I know I’ve mentioned it quite a few times, but you need to know that it’s really really important. If you don’t have a list, you don’t have a business.</p> 
        <p class="post-text">So, opt-ins are connected to autoresponders. Your landing page has to be attractive and engaging for the people who see it. On your opt-in page, you make an offer to your audience where you give them something in exchange for their email. Whenever someone enters their email address, your autoresponder automatically delivers them the promised product. Once you get their email in your database, you can retarget them as you please. This way, you can sell more products to your audience. Autoresponders automate most of the process and they are fairly easy to understand. This is your actual business model, that’s how it works. There are many autoresponders that you can choose from, here are few of the suggestions,</p>
        <ol class="post-text">
            <li> Getresponse</li>
            <li>MarketHero</li>
            <li>Aweber</li>
            <li>Convertkit</li>
            <li>Ontraport</li>
            <li>InfusionSoft</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="col my-4">
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Product selection</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Product selection is obviously an important aspect affiliate marketing as you won’t be able to sell if you picked the wrong products. There are many platforms where you can look for products to promote. Some of the most famous ones are</p> 
       <ol class="post-text">
        <li> Click Bank</li>
        <li>JV Zoo</li>
        <li>Amazon Associates</li>
       </ol>
       <p class="post-text">The product you pick must fit with your chosen niche. If you don’t, you most likely won’t sell anything. You must know what your product is about and how it resonates with your niche. Know your niche well, put in the work, do the research. If you know in depth information about your product, it’s relatively easier to sell. On your affiliate marketplace, there are usually pages specifically for affiliates where info about a product is provided to help them promote. These usually include email swipes and stacked information that you can use any way you like.</p> 
       <p class="post-text">When you promote a product, always make sure that you provide value and that you’re actually making an effort to make the lives of your potential customers comparatively easier or better than it was. You must believe in the product you promote, and in my opinion, you shouldn’t compromise on the quality. You need to maintain that trust and you should be willing to put in the work.</p> 
        <p class="post-text"> Another thing that you can do is, promote something that’s already circulating good in the market. What it means is to pick a product that other affiliates are already selling. It creates a sense of security for the people who buy it and thus, easier for you to sell. When looking for a product, look for a product with the highest gravity. Gravity is basically the exact same thing that I told you about. It’s how much a product is being circulated in the market. So, the higher the gravity, the better it is for you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col my-4">
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Traffic generation and product promotion</h2>

        
        <p class="post-text">Traffic generation is the hardest part of being an online business person. It doesn’t matter how good your product is, if no one knows about it, it’s next to useless. The problem is, generating quality traffic takes time and effort. It’s fairly easy if you go for paid traffic. But if you don’t have the capital to invest in paid traffic just yet, you will need to hustle a lot. Although paid traffic is always preferred, however, it is possible to scale a business with free traffic too. Obviously, you will need to work more, but it can be done.</p>
        <p class="post-text">The most important thing is, you don’t want random people to your website or landing page or whatever it is that you are going for. You need a certain kind of people who fall under your niche and would make your ideal audience base. Looking for such people can be a little harder, and traffic generation is something that every single one of us struggles with.
        </p> 
        <p class="post-text"> A good way to get quality traffic is to post on forums and building an audience base on social platforms like Instagram, twitter, facebook and the like. Put a lot of content on the internet and build an audience.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Pinterest is also considered one of the best platforms for getting traffic and traction. Get in touch with the people who are already doing what you’re doing. These communities can help you out in a lot of ways and can also help you grow faster. So, definitely, do that.</p>
    </div>
   
    <div class="col my-4">
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Sales pitch
        </h2>

        <p class="post-text">Sales pitches are one of the most tricky elements in internet marketing. You need to be very careful with these. Make sure you don’t throw a product in people’s face when they’re not yet ready to buy. Build trust and communicate like a person and not like a machine. Human beings like to be treated as human beings and you’re taking up their space in their email inboxes which are personal to them, so, make sure you don’t spam them. No one likes spam. NO ONE!
        </p> 
        <p class="post-text"> Once you’ve established that trust, then you pitch them for a product. Your sales pitch must not include words like, to be frank, trust me, sorry to bother you, just following up with you, buy, I haven’t heard from you, and the like. These have been used in an extreme amount in the past by salespeople so they automatically trigger the response that you are selling something and it creates a barrier between you and the prospect. Be casual, don’t be too formal. Always remember, people love to buy, they hate to be sold.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Your sales pitch shouldn’t be too long, too short or aimed at the wrong person. It won’t work if either of the above applies to it. Be specific, be precise and use your words very carefully. You have to be interesting, engaging and to the point. Don’t make it entirely about you as a seller, or even the product. Make it about the client and how it will change their life for the better. People don’t buy stuff, people buy results. Show them the result, and then introduce your product as a means to achieve that result, hence, investing in your product or service. Don’t forget to write a closing letter. It acknowledges the fact that you’re looking forward to being in business with them and it had been a great ride.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col my-4">
        <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Beginner mistakes</h2>

        <p class="post-text">Being a beginner, it’s only natural that you would make mistakes. And in business, if you’re going to make mistakes, make them early on so your venture doesn’t suffer in the long run. You will make mistakes, don’t let them have a lasting impact on your business. The point is, don’t work inside of a bubble. Experiment and execute on the new theories that you have in your head. See what works and what does not. There’s only one way about this. And always remember, nothing is unfixable. It may take some time, but it’s absolutely doable. Even if you mess up, there is going to be a way to minimize the damage and to learn from it, so don’t resist change, welcome it, it’s part of the learning curve.</p> 
        <p class="post-text"> One of the most common mistakes associated with internet marketing is, people give up too soon. If you’re scaling a business model online or anywhere, you need to understand that it’s going to take time. Nothing works overnight. You can’t have a baby in a month by having sex with nine women, it just doesn’t work like that. You need to keep putting in the work and don’t think that you will earn anything significant for about a year or two. You will need atleast that much time to understand something well enough to generate the returns that you probably want.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Now, it doesn’t mean that you won’t earn anything at all, what it means is to not have your expectations too high that you end up quiting the entire thing. All that’s required is for you is to lower your standards enough that you actually get up and put in the work.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Another mistake that is fairly common is people don’t completely understand what they’re promoting. If you don’t understand it yourself, you can’t possibly convince someone else to buy it from you. Research is important. Put in the time and study. If you don’t understand your product, you won’t be able to get to the right audience and nothing will work unless you do business with the right kind of people.</p> 
        <p class="post-text"> Another thing to keep in mind is, don’t bombard your audience with stuff. Maintain a low information diet and provide as much value as you can. And make sure that you’re marketing to the right people. Having the right audience base is the as important as your marketing.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">Spend some time of the day learning about your field. Study your competition and figure out how you can leverage that information.</p>
