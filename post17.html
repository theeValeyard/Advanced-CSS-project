                <p class="post-text">Everyone loves flowers because flowers make us feel good. Flowers are nature's way
                    to smile at us,
                    and more often than not, we're bound to smile back. Being happy is a choice, yet most of us choose
                    otherwise. The way you feel about something can be a powerful thing. And flowers make us forget our
                    worries and insecurities, at least for a little while. Even science believes in the magical effect
                    that flowers
                    have on us. So, let's dive a little deeper to know what that actually means and how flowers actually
                    make
                    us feel good.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Help you sleep better</h2>

                <p class="post-text">It has been scientifically proven that flower scents have sleep-inducing qualities
                    in them. Today almost everyone has a messed up sleep schedule. In this internet age, no one really
                    sleeps. And lack of sleep or lack of good sleep can be really harmful to your body.</p>
                <p class="post-text">If you have flowers in your room, they can help you sleep better. Flowers have a
                    healing property and a calming effect on our minds, so even if you don't have flowers in your room,
                    you should consider getting them.</p>
            </div>

                    they could boost creativity as high as 45%. Creative work or any work of art has a tendency to make
                    you feel satisfied and blissful. Following your bliss is art meant for the chosen few. But flowers
                    make you feel good by just being there. Who would have thought that the humble plant can be so
                    special?
                </p>

                    The scent and view of flowers automatically signals our minds to be happier and relaxed. And there's
                    beauty in the peace, there's power in the calm.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;"> Makes you happy</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Now, it may seem highly obvious, but it sure is worth pointing out. Flowers make
                    everyone happy. After a stressful day at work, a 15-minute walk through a garden can lift your
                    spirits again. Life doesn't need to be fancy and glittery, life just needs to be lived. Flowers make
                    you appreciate the little things in life.

                    just on the surface, but to the deepest core. Happiness is choice and flowers are fragmented pockets
                    of happiness that you should share anytime you can. It can make someone's day, and it can save your
                    soul from the gloom. Life won't be this hard if we chose to look out for each other.</p>
            </div>

                    help you recover faster. A lot of times flowers were found to reduce hospital stays and lower
                    painkiller dosage. They trigger your body to feel healthier and stronger.</p>
                <p class="post-text">You feel good after receiving flowers from a loved one because it gives you a

                    presence of flowers.

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Enhance your tolerance to pain</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Flowers are scientifically proven to increase your pain tolerance. It was observed
                    that pain killer dosage was reduced in patients who were surrounded by flowers. So, next time you
                    visit a hospital, take some flowers with you. If you have a friend or anyone from the family who is
                    suffering some serious disease, make sure they have fresh flowers around them. It keeps them hopeful
                    and optimistic.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Little things like these can have a major psychological effect on the minds of
                    people. So, if you're even in a position to show a fellow human being some kindness, you should not
                    back down from it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Helps you live in the moment</h2>

                <p class="post-text">When you look at something peaceful and soothing, you forget the past and the
                    future for a while. We human beings have a tendency to live in our heads, and moments like these
                    help us snap out of them. When you look at a beautiful flower in a garden, you pause for a moment to
                    stare at as it makes you feel good. When you're staring at it, you're in that moment, living it.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">Human beings misuse the two most important gifts they have that no other animal on
                    the planet has, which are, a profound sense of memory and a vivid sense of imagination. We can still
                    feel bad for a traumatic memory that happened 10 years ago, and we already suffer what the coming
                    future will be. Flowers kind of save us from ourselves by helping us forget our worries and
                    appreciate the perfection of the moment.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Make you more responsible</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Flowers give a sense of purpose and responsibility. If you choose to keep flowers,
                    they require a lot of maintenance, and you need to constantly take care of their needs. And while
                    you do that, they also give you a great sense of accomplishment can satisfaction.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Tending to your tiny little garden can be your favorite time of the day. And
                    knowing that you're responsible for everything that happens to it makes you more punctual and
                    dedicated to do it.</p>

                    everyone.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Enhances your memory</h2>

                <p class="post-text">We live in the modern age of the internet and more information is no longer the
                    answer. We are bombarded with huge loads of information, and we need to filter through it to know
                    which amount we actually need. Giving your mind some time to rest can be a good idea in the midst of
                    this information overload. If you take out the time to do nothing but stare at flowers, they help
                    you rejuvenate your memory and the way you process information.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">It can be stressful to deal with everything, and taking a walk through the garden
                    might be all the therapy you need. Learn to appreciate the little things in life, this little life
                    lesson will go a long way.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Helps you relax and helps with anxiety</h2>

                <p class="post-text">A lot of young adults and teenagers suffer crippling anxiety at times. Even when we
                    have most of our physical needs met, emotional turmoil can take a toll on anyone. We live in a world
                    of utmost mental instability. There are a lot of things that are not right. Flowers symbolize hope
                    and the courage to keep moving ahead, even if the hit you endured was more than you could take.</p>
                <p class="post-text">They help reduce anxiety by filling you with the happy hormone and gives your mind
                    the much- needed rest.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">Every once in a while you should just sit back and admire the art of nature. Nature
                    always finds ways to make us feel small. And that can be a powerful thing, to admit that you're part
                    of something bigger than yourself. Even if life was rough to you, you need to choose healing,
                    because no one else can do it for you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Help you find a significant other</h2>

                <p class="post-text">There is an age-old relationship between flowers and romantic dates. Our media
                    projected flowers as a symbol of love, and nothing can be more true than that. In the romantic epics
                    and movies alike, flowers always have a role to play when one is in the pursuit of love. So, if
                    you're looking for a partner, you might not want to forget your bouquet of perfect roses.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">Love is one of the purest feelings a man has the bliss to feel, however, humans
                    still found a way to corrupt it whenever possible. But, don't let that mistake you into the absence
                    of love in today's world. True love still exists. Its existence is like that of magic. Those who
                    don't believe in magic will never find it. And in the end, happiness is only true when shared. You
                    can have the world to yourself, but if you didn't have anyone to share it with, it won't mean much.
                    And to remind you again, don't forget your flowers.</p>
                <p class="post-text">So, to conclude, flowers are obviously more than just plants. Life becomes easier
                    and more beautiful when we choose to look at the beauty. Flowers represent the spring season, which
                    symbolizes new beginnings and healing. So, next time you see any flowers, don't miss out on the
                    forest for the trees.</p>
