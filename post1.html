                <p class="post-text"> With the rise of Game of Thrones the interest in fantasy fiction genre has been
                    reinvigorated, the sales of the books have gained a major boost and with the community thriving it's
                    the best time to get into fantasy. Here are a few suggestions for both beginners and intermediate
                    readers to experience the best that fantasy has to offer.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Six of Crows</h2>

                <p class="post-text"><strong>"If you can't beat the odds, change the game." </strong></p>
                <p class="post-text"> The shortest series on this list with only two parts is The Six of Crows Duology.
                    The series is written by Leigh Bardugo and is set in Shadow and Bone Trilogy universe (Grishaverse)
                    more commonly known as the Grisha trilogy. The series has no prior connection to the previous books
                    except for a few minor characters and one small incident. You need not have read the other books to
                    enjoy this duology but if you like six of crows you can then move on to the Grisha trilogy. Another
                    thing to note is that Leigh Bardugo is one of the few female fantasy writers and is putting out
                    great work on consistent bases.</p>
                <p class="post-text">
                    The series is set in the Amsterdam inspired city of Kitterdam and follows six characters as they are
                    hired to pull off a heist/ rescue mission. This kind of story has not been explored that often
                    especially in fantasy and certainly not with this much charm. We get the chapters from the viewpoint
                    of almost all the main characters and a few minor ones too. The cast is some of the most likable and
                    varied in all of fantasy and their banter never leaves a dull moment.

                <p class="post-text"><strong>"The life of a person is more than the chaos of its passing."</strong></p>
                <p class="post-text"> Brandon Sanderson is the only author with two entries on this list and for good
                    reason, he's one of the best and most hardworking authors right now, which is to be expected as he
                    was the one to finish the wheel of time series after the passing of Robert Jordan.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">
                    Mistborn is set in a region called the final empire on a world known as Scadrial. A thousand years
                    before the start of the series the hero of ages was set to destroy the Deepness. Although the
                    Deepness was successfully repelled, its true nature has been lost to time. The Hero after his
                    victory changed the world to likeness and dupped himself the Lord Ruler and has been ruling over the
                    world as the god and tyrant.</p>
                <p class="post-text">
                    We follow Vin, a street urchin as she is recruited by a rebellion to overthrow the lord ruler. She
                    was selected because of her being a Mistborn.
                    The series has one of the best magic systems around, the main part of the magic system is Allomancy.
                    The power to Metoblise (burn) metals to gain temporary powers or boost to one's abilities. Mistborns
                    are those rare people who can metabolize all the metals (16 in Total) whereas the rest can burn only
                    one.</p>
                <p class="post-text">
                    Also, if you like the series then you are in luck as there's a sequel tetralogy set 300 after the
                    last book and focus one the world as it goes through its industrialization phase. Another trilogy is
                    only planned to be released in the same universe.

                <p class="post-text"> This is the next series on this list by Brandon Sanderson and is without a doubt
                    his magnum opus. If he keeps up the quality which there is a high chance he will; it will be
                    remembered as the Lord Of The Rings of this century. The series is planned to have 10 books with the
                    first part of the story consisting of the first five books and the second part of the later 5 books.
                    The first 3 books have already been released and the 4th book is set to release in 2020. He is one
                    of the few authors pushing out the content of this scale and quality on consistent bases.

                <p class="post-text">
                    So, the series takes place in a world called Roshar where there are frequent storms so the people
                    and environment have evolved to survive these storms. The prologue introduces us to the concept of
                    the wars that take place every few centuries between the humans and the void bringer. Ten heralds
                    fight by the humanities side in these wars but after the last war, nine of the ten heralds decide to
                    break their oath and leave. After some 4500 years, humanity believes that the void bringers have
                    been defeated once and for all but our 3 lead characters sense that something is wrong.

                <p class="post-text">
                    Storm light again has one of the best magic systems with things like Shardblades and Shardplate.
                    The books are written in such a way that a single novel gives the feel of a complete trilogy with
                    short stories sprinkled in between to build a complex and amazing world.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">A Song Of Ice And Fire</h2>

                <p class="post-text"><strong>
                        "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."</strong></p>
                <p class="post-text">Currently, the most famous series on this list is A Song Of Ice And Fire. The show
                    is undeniably one the best shows of all time with one the worst ends. The books are the good parts
                    you remember from the show, all the witty dialogue, all the backstabbing, and politics. The
                    popularity of the game of thrones has started a trend of realistic grimdark fantasy and is going to
                    be remembered as one of the most influential books in the fantasy genre.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">
                    For those still unaware of the story, Game of Thrones takes place on the fictional continent of
                    Westeros where two rival families ( Starks and Lannisters) fight for power while a world-ending
                    threat makes its way to them. What's special about this series is the number of characters and their
                    complex relations with each other the scope of which not everyone can pull off. The writing style is
                    also amazing if you like to soak up as much detail as you can about the world. The dialogue is
                    simply amazing to read especially anything that includes TyrionLannister.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">
                    The only small issue is that the last two books of the series have been on hold for a long time.
                    And,the fifth book in the series was released in 2011 and it’s been 9 years without and official
                    announcement for the release of the next books. All things point to a possible 2020 release but even
                    if that does happen the last part is even further. All things considered, it still is one of the
                    best stories being told in all of fiction and is worth the commitment.</p>

                <p class="post-text">Another series that is on the rise because of its adaptations is The Witcher. First
                    adapted into a game series by polish developers CD Project Red which garnered overwhelming critical
                    acclaim especially the 3rd part in the series widely considered the best game of this decade and
                    recently the Netflix series which became the most in-demand show of 2019.

                <p class="post-text">
                    The novels are written by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski who started by writing short stories in
                    the witcher universe. The main story is known as the Witcher saga. The world of the witcher has been
                    inspired by the Gaelic/Celtic mythology which is a welcome break from all the western-inspired
                    novels. There is a feeling that you are reading about something new and interesting.

                <p class="post-text">
                    The series follows the titular witcher Geralt of Rivia. Witchers are monster hunters who are created
                    through mutations and very harsh training. The witchers were once respected but now they are
                    despised and treated as outcasts. The main saga follows Geralt as he tries to save and raise the
                    child of destiny princess Ciri.</p>
                <p class="post-text">
                    The series has garnered a cult following and is currently blowing up in the mainstream. Geralt is
                    easily one of the best-written characters and his relationship with everyone is the star of the
                    series.</p>
