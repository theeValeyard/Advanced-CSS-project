                <p class="post-text">A lot of people struggle with work life balance and a lot of people face stress at
                    work. Then there are
                    people who work too much that it leaves them physically and mentally drained. There is nothing
                    wrong with them, they are addicted to working. Working long hours is an option, and if people like
                    to get
                    that high from work, telling them otherwise is of no use, because they won't listen anyway. Working
                    makes them happier. But it can be really harmful for your health and that is a major issue. If you
                    are
                    doing it out of pressure then it really needs to stop.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Fear of missing out is a real thing, but being a stressed out workaholic is not the
                    answer to that. If you find yourself in similar situations, and if you want to take control of your
                    life in a healthier and happier way, this article is for you.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Why you need to slow down?</h2>

                <p class="post-text">You may be thinking if you are working long hours to achieve more, what exactly is
                    the problem? Sacrifices need to be made, right? You want something, you got to give something in
                    return. Well, no. This is the worst possible way to look at the situation. First of all, most people
                    don't know what their actual goal is and they are not working towards a specific thing.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> They think they are getting somewhere, but they are just running around in
                    circles. Yes, ambition fuels passion. But you need a vessel strong enough to be able to wield that
                    passion. Take care of yourself, you owe your body that much.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text">Secondly, there is a huge difference between being busy and being productive. Most
                    people mistake being busy for being productive. So, they feel stressed out, tired, and feel like
                    they didn't really do anything. It is bad for everything, the mind, the body, and even the work. And
                    besides, no goal and ambition is bigger than your life. You need to slow down and value the right
                    things.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Avoiding burnout</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Your body is not an infinity machine. It needs maintenance, repairs and rest.
                    Working 20 hours a day and then having the next 48 hours to be absolutely miserable is not a very
                    smart choice. You might do it with a hit of caffeine, but it will wear off sooner than you think.
                    Then your body will take double the time to recover. Even if you need to work longer hours, you need
                    balance and planning. Start by working one hour extra every day until you get used to it. Don't
                    overdo yourself, your body will make you restore the balance anyway. And if you are stubborn, it
                    will be harder than it needs to be.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> Listen to your body, everything else can follow. Unless you are going through some
                    serious emergency, your body needs rest. Don't burn out, it is not worth it. The problem is, people
                    overestimate what they can do in a day, and underestimate what they can do in a year. So, don't fool
                    yourself, because, in the end, it is you who pays the price.

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Prioritizing sleep</h2>

                <p class="post-text">A lot of workaholics don't give enough importance to sleep. This is the first step
                    towards destroying your external and internal peace. Some people are efficient with sleeping 4 hours
                    a day, but not everyone is. Be a sleep first kind of person. Everything else can wait. Don't force
                    your limits too much. Even more sleep is not the answer. You need quality sleep. If you are more
                    active, you are more likely to perform better and feel better.</p>
                <p class="post-text">
                    Your body needs to be well rested, to achieve something productive. The goal is to work the least
                    amount of hours to achieve the maximum results. As an adult, you need at least 6 hours of sleep
                    every day. If you are younger, you need to sleep even more. Also, avoid sleeping in on weekends, it
                    messes up the routine and the more you fall out of it, the more difficult it will be to get back
                    into it.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Being in the present</h2>

                <p class="post-text">We are very rarely in the present. Human beings live inside of their heads for the
                    most part. Humans misuse two of their greatest gifts, a vivid sense of memory and an infinite sense
                    of imagination. We can be hurt by something that happened years ago, and we already suffer what is
                    coming. Being in the present takes you away from all those problems. Remember that, life is not
                    about wishing you were somewhere, or someone that you are not. Life is about enjoying where you are,
                    loving who you are, and consistently improving both.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> Look around you, there is nothing out there to hurt you. Everything is fine, and
                    you are still in control. If you are anxious about work, or any other reason, here is a
                    psychological trick that you can use. Look around for one thing that you can see, one thing that you
                    can touch, one thing that you can smell, one thing that you can hear and one thing that you can
                    taste. It snaps you out of your head and into the real world.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Take out at least 20 to 25 minutes a day to ponder over your life and your level of
                    happiness. Happiness is the top priority. If you are not happy, it is all for nothing. I don't mean
                    write, read or anything of the sort, these things get you right back inside of your head (although
                    that is not a very bad thing but you need to spend some time out of your head and be a part of
                    reality, knowing that it matters. You will be surprised to know how much time you spend inside your
                    head.) Acknowledge the present and that you are currently living in the present, and that you are
                    quite literally alive and are aware of it. Most people realize it too late. Life is happening around
                    you, witness it and be a part of it. You never know what is coming next, and you may not get another
                    chance. Life does not happen twice.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Being a human</h2>

                <p class="post-text">If you are a workaholic, it is not just about you. It is about everyone you are
                    close to. No relationships work like that. They may try to understand, but they are human beings and
                    human beings need human emotion. Don't be a robot, life has more to offer than just work. Value the
                    right things, value relationships, value time you get to spend with yourself or your family or your
                    loved ones. Being a human is more important than being skilled at anything. Obviously, skills have
                    their utility, but that is no excuse for not being a good human being.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> Everyone needs work life balance, and it is fine. You don't need to go to
                    extremes. Life is much more beautiful than meets the eye, and you should never miss out on that kind
                    of beauty. Value the life inside of you, being stuck somewhere you don't want to be will not help
                    you. The life you want is bigger than your fear, and it is worth it. You are not missing out. You
                    have time. Do things that actually make you feel happier. Things that make you want to get out of
                    your bed every day. If you look long enough, you will find it. Just do not stop looking until you
                    do.</p>
