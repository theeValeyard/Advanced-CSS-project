                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;"> How to recognize and ease your pet’s anxiety?</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Anxiety is more common in dogs than you might think. All dogs can get anxious at
                    times, but if it is too frequent, you need to do something about it. There are a lot of factors that
                    may result in your dog feeling anxious, and luckily there are a lot of things that you can do to
                    help. The thing is, most people are not good at recognizing anxiety in their pets. And some breeds
                    are more prone to anxiety than others. So, you need to train them differently.
                </p>
                <p class="post-text"> If you need to leave your dog alone while you work, it is even more important.
                    Your dog is your responsibility, and you need to take care of all its needs. A lot of the times a
                    dog gets anxious when it thinks that it needs to protect you from any kind of potential danger. You
                    need to make sure that you trust your dog at all times and your dog trusts you at all times. Being
                    separated from you all day can lead to them being feeling alone, and they may wreck the entire house
                    by the time you return. Now, it can also be because they are bored, but worry can also cause them to
                    act like that.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Signs to look out for</h2>
                <ol class="post-text">
                    <li>Does your dog whine a lot?</li>
                    <li>Does your dog cower away in the presence of other dogs or humans?</li>
                    <li>Does your dog get very shaky and restless?</li>
                    <li>Does your dog not get along with other humans or dogs and prefer to be left alone?</li>
                    <li>Does your dog show avoidance of certain objects or runs away in the presence of some things or
                        people?</li>
                    <li>Does your dog show aggression frequently? (Aggression is a symptom, not the cause of the
                        problem, so remember to treat it like a symptom)</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Do you trust your dog completely?</h2>

                <p class="post-text"> Lack of trust between the dog and the owner can lead to anxiety and abnormal
                    behavior.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> And most importantly, your anxiety has a lot to do with your dog being anxious.
                    Dogs pick up your vibe. So, if you struggle with anxiety, it can be the major reason why your dog is
                    too. Your pets copy your behavior, so you should do something for both your problems. If it gets too
                    much, you might even need to give your pet anti-depressants to cope up with everything. These are
                    the basic signs that your dog might be experiencing anxiety. But make sure that none of these things
                    are a sign of a physical problem. Call a vet to make sure that everything is okay.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Here are a few things that can help make things better</h2>
                <ol class="post-text">
                    <li>
                        <h4> Practice obedience </h4>
                        <p class="post-text">Practicing obedience with your dog can help things as when your dog is
                            anxious and hears a familiar command, it helps it calm down. Start with basic things like
                            sit, stand, stay, etc. Dogs can pick up these things fairly easily, keep them motivated with
                            treats and you will achieve that in less than a week.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Use positive reinforcement</h4>
                        <p class="post-text">Use positive reinforcement to train your dog, which means, you reward it
                            for every desirable action with a treat or something nice. Don’t punish them harshly when
                            they don’t listen to you. They are animals, they need time to learn. Promote positive and
                            friendly behavior.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Exercise and playing</h4>
                        <p class="post-text">Dogs need to train physically, they are made that way. Dogs can easily run
                            miles as they have a really strong build. You want to keep them active physically. It is
                            recommended that you go on at least three walks a day. Two of them can be small, like 15 to
                            20 minutes each. And one long, like 40 to 45 minutes of walking. Get them to physically
                            exert themselves. If you need to wake up early to do that, so be it. If you have a tight
                            schedule because of work, consider hiring someone to play with your dog. Remember, that you
                            decided to have a dog, you need to take care of all its needs.</p>
                        <p class="post-text">You can also invest in some toys that allow your dogs to physically exert
                            themselves and feel fulfilled at the end of the day. Work on having a really strong
                            relationship with your pets.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Don’t get them excited about leaving</h4>
                        <p class="post-text">When you leave for work, don’t hug and kiss your dog goodbye. Especially if
                            it is going to be alone for a long time. You are indirectly teaching your dog that this is
                            the time where I leave you alone for a long amount of time. Instead, just leave without
                            saying goodbye. Don’t talk to your dog before you leave.</p>
                        <p class="post-text">On your days off, practice that. Leave for 2 minutes, and then come back,
                            then leave for a little longer, and come back. It teaches your dog that it needs to wait for
                            you when you are gone and it is okay. And have a positive and non-stressful approach towards
                            that.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Give them something to do</h4>
                        <p class="post-text">A lot of the times dogs get anxious when they don’t have anything to do.
                            So, they sit for a minute, think ‘oh heck, I got nuffin to do’ and then wreck your entire
                            house. Give them something to look forward to. Get them long-lasting chew toys or a ball
                            thrower or something. Basically, something they can do instead of getting anxious.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Make them feel comfortable inside and outside the house</h4>
                        <p class="post-text">You want your dog to be comfortable and in control when someone comes to
                            your house and not just lash out at them. It happens because your dog feels the need to
                            protect you and just scares the hell out of the poor stranger in the process of doing so.
                            And if you’re walking and your dog starts to act out if a stranger passes you by, it’s
                            because of the same reason. You want your dog to be at ease when it is inside the house or
                            outside. Make your dog comfortable with other people and just balance its instinct to
                            protect you with how the world works. Make your dog understand that everything is not a
                            threat.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Conclusion</h2>
                <p class="post-text">It’s hard keeping a dog at times, but we all know it’s totally worth it. Invest
                    some of your time and energy into it, and you can have a happy and fulfilled life for both you and
                    your dog. Work on small things, and watch them bring big changes to your life. Give your dogs a
                    direction. And if you feel like you’re not good enough for that, have someone train it for a while.
                    Either way, your dog is your responsibility. We hope we were able to help out in some way. If you
                    have any other suggestions, do let us know in the comments.
