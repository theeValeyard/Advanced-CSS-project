                <p class="post-text">Folklores play a major role in shaping the culture of a region. In simpler words,
                    it is the oral history preserved by the people of a culture to remember their origin and how they
                    came to be. So, folklores hold historical value. These traditions are unofficial beliefs and
                    practices that help in forming the cultural identity over time.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <p class="post-text">Back in the day, most people couldn't read or write. Literacy was rare and only the
                    kings and nobles could afford scribes and illustrators. So, word of mouth was the only way for
                    common folk to have a sense of belonging and stay connected to their roots. Information and skills
                    were passed from one generation to the next through word of mouth. Folklore includes folk songs,
                    fairy tales and folk tales, ballads, rhymes, and folk dramas and the like. Folklore validates
                    culture, justifying its rituals and customs and how they came to be.

            <div class="col my-4">
                <p class="post-text">People used to transfer information from one place to another. It is believed that
                    there were strolling bands of people who traveled between cities, performed tricks, sang songs,
                    walked tightropes and entertained the townsfolk for a living. These people were the medium of
                    communication. This was the way of common people to preserve their history. A lot of people are
                    confused between folklore and mythology. Though they have similarities, but they are not the same
                    thing. It's because folklore is a collection of fictional tales about animals and people. Everyone
                    has come across some kind of folklore in their life.

                <p class="post-text">You may have heard of the minstrels singing for the king or storytellers telling
                    bedtime stories to young princes and princesses. Fairytales were one of the important features of
                    oral history. But fairytales weren't originally invented for children. A lot of popular classics
                    like beauty and the beast, cinderella have been inspired by fairytales but if you research and read
                    the original versions of the stories, you would be surprised to know how they end.

                <p class="post-text">Folklores were considered a good way to reinforce morals and values and to develop
                    wit. These could be scary stories or moral lessons. These continue generation after generation to
                    keep those moral values alive. Folklore shaped the way common people did things.

                <p class="post-text">Viking lore is considered to be one of the best. It's a rich collection of songs,
                    stories, and legends. They were considered to be strong and furious. Everyone has heard the stories
                    of mighty Thor and his hammer. Indian folklore is diverse and vast. India is a large country, so
                    describing Indian folklore under one unit is not possible. Folk heroes like Rama and Krishna from
                    Sanskrit epics are idealized as gods to this very day. Folk culture is a part of modern-day
                    literature.

                <p class="post-text">In the same way as Astronomy is a real science whereas Astrology is not. But
                    Astrology set the foundation for the astronomy to catch up to logic. If you tell people to get all
                    the ideas in their heads in front of the masses, being right or wrong is a matter of the future.
                    Same way, folklore has shaped the world that we live in today. It may not be an actual science, and
                    it may be hard for some people to believe, that it was the stepping stone to letting the science and
                    technology progress as they have.

                <p class="post-text">Folklore reflects a culture by relating to the people who created it. It influences
                    their beliefs, customs, and the way they perceive the world. There are countless cultures around the
                    world, and each of them perceives the world differently. Folktales from all over the world center on
                    the same motifs, supernatural beings, magical objects, extraordinary animals, powers, and
                    transformations. Supernatural beings in folktales are either adversaries or helpers. Extraordinary
                    animals are also considered popular characters in folktales all over the world. Many folktales are
                    based on magical objects or powers and on characters that transform themselves.

                    Culture enhances the quality of an individual's life. And at the end of the day, we're human beings.
                    The reason we intentionally keep and create traditions is that they give value to our celebrations.
                    They give us a sense of belonging and nurture the family spirit to help us bond with the ones we
                    love. It is about human suffering and pain transmitted in the folk narrative, material culture and
                    performing arts.
