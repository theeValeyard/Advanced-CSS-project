                <p class="post-text">Some kind of physical activity is essential for you and your dog alike. A lot of
                    times, we neglect
                    our health as an excuse for having a tight schedule and having to work too much. But we all
                    know that we should be investing some of our time into our well being. More importantly, when
                    we bring an animal into our lives, we need to take care of all its physical, physiological, and
                    mental needs. It is even more important for an animal because it doesn’t have a lot of options
                    when it comes to things to do like we as humans do.</p>
                <p class="post-text">So, one thing is clear, exercise for dogs is important. Which brings us to the next
                    part, which is,
                    how to exercise your dog? So, when it comes to exercising your dog, you want to do a little bit
                    of research beforehand. The activity level of your dog can depend on age and breed. Some
                    breeds are naturally more active, while others are a little bit relaxed. So, you don’t want to
                    overexert your dog right away. The age of the dog must also be taken under consideration as
                    you can end up doing more harm than good.</p>
                <p class="post-text">One of the most important things is, make sure your dog is having fun. None of it
                    should seem
                    like a task to it. You want your dog to be genuinely excited about everything you do together.
                    Especially if you have a tight schedule, you want the time you spend with your dog to be even
                    more rewarding. It should be something that you and your dog both look forward to. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Body and mind</h2>

                <p class="post-text">When it comes to training or exercising your dog, you need to focus on both, the
                    body and the
                    mind. Having an understanding dog is still a dream for many people, and I know you can relate
                    to this. So, you want your dog to be mentally and physically healthy, just like yourself. If your
                    dog is mentally healthy and understanding, it is much less likely to experience anxiety. And the
                    vessel needs to be trained too, to be able to deal with any illness or difficulty that may arise.
                    Also, if you are exercising a dog that has been a house dog for a long while, you want to take it
                    easy. Its body is not ready for the field yet, so you need to take a gradual approach as to not hurt
                    it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Preparations</h2>

                <p class="post-text">You will need to prepare the environment and your dog for exercise. It is best if
                    you have some
                    help. One of the most important things is, never forget to bring water. Always make sure that
                    your dog has access to water. You want to choose a safe place that doesn’t have too many
                    distractions.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> Take care of the surface. Avoid any hard and slippery surfaces. They may harm your
                    dog’s
                    joints and legs. The grass is always a better option. If you don’t have access to real grass,
                    consider going for the artificial option. You want your floofs to have a good grip and control over
                    their body. Be careful with running exercises, especially if your dog is running downhill. Running
                    downhill can damage your dog’s legs and muscles. So, you want to be careful with all the
                    downhill exercises.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Walking is not enough</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Even though walking is a great exercise, it is not enough sometimes. We are not
                    able to take
                    our dogs on a long enough hike. Their bodies are really strong and they are designed to walk
                    and run long distances. So, for most of us, it’s not practically possible to walk our dogs that
                    much. So, all things considered, you need to find additional ways to physically exert your pet.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Play fetch</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Playing fetch can be a great exercise for your dog and you won’t have to exert
                    yourself as
                    much. Although, it can be difficult to teach your dog how to play fetch. Try it in a safe
                    environment where your dog can’t run away too far. You want to do it away from any danger of
                    cars or kids or other people. These things can confuse your dog and it can also be stressful for
                    other people. Make sure you’re able to control your dog at all times. And don’t try to chase your
                    dog for it to come back. It becomes a game of catch me if you can and trust me, you will never
                    outrun those four legs. Once your dog understands what’s going on, it can be a fun experience
                    for both of you. You can watch some dog training videos to teach your dog how to fetch properly.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Swimming</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Swimming is a really effective and underrated exercise, it tires you out and
                    exercises your entire
                    body. There are facilities where you can take your dog for a swim. If you have a natural water
                    body within reach that’s safe enough, you can try that as well. But make sure you do it in a safe
            </div>
            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Practicing tricks</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Practicing tricks with your dog can be a good exercise for your dog and a little
                    bit easier on you
                    as well. You can try simple things like teaching your dog basic commands like sit, stand, spin,
                    etc. You can also teach your dog to come to you when you call its name. And you want to do
                    something rewarding for your dog to keep it interested. You can use toys like tugs, or balls, or
                    whatever your dog likes. You can also use treats if your dog is more food motivated. If you can
                    keep your dog engaged and interested for a long enough time, they will learn to obey you. But
                    make sure that you only use positive reinforcement. Don’t punish your dogs if they don’t do
                    something right. They are animals, they need time to learn. You want this experience to be
                    fulfilling for both of you.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> It is obviously going to take some time, but it will be a healthier step for both
                    of you. You need to
                    take care of your body and mind. Just make sure, that your mental status doesn’t affect your
                    dog negatively. They are good at picking up emotions.</p>
