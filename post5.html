                <p class="post-text">If you have a dog, training it properly should be one of the things you consider
                    seriously. You can’t expect your dog to act right if it doesn’t know how to act right. In that case,
                    you can’t blame it on the dog. And it may seem cute while he is a puppy, but once your dog is grown
                    up, it can be really difficult to control him at times, as some dogs tend to grow very big. And it
                    doesn’t even take that long. You won’t even realize where the time went.</p>
                <p class="post-text">Now, training your dog does not mean being too stern or uptight, it’s actually the
                    exact opposite of that. We realize how cute and pawfect your furry paws are, but you also need to
                    realize that you need to teach them certain things.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;"> When can you train a dog</h2>


                <p class="post-text"> Many people believe that dogs can only be trained while they’re young. That’s
                    absolutely not true. You can train a dog at any age. It’s just that, it is easier to control them
                    while they are small.</p>
                <p class="post-text">You just need to have a strong bond with your dog. However, it is best that you
                    start training a dog as early as you can. You can start when the puppy is about 10 to 12 weeks old.
                    Start simple and then keep adding things to it.</p>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Let the dog take his time</h2>

                <p class="post-text">
                    When you’re training your dog, your dog has some say in it as well. Take it easy, and let the dog
                    take his time. Keep the dog motivated and make sure that he is having fun. Keep the experience
                    rewarding. You can play with your dog to get him excited or give him his favorite treats when he
                    does something right.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> Make the dog feel safe and let him know that he can trust you, that you’re there
                    and you won’t let anything bad happen to him. It will help him ease up be more comfortable.</p>
                <p class="post-text">If your dog is not comfortable with something, don’t force it. It is time to take a
                    step back and let the dog adjust. Eventually, it will.

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;"> Play with your dog</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Playtime is the most cherished time for our dogs. You can use it as a golden
                    opportunity to train your dog. Use the toy of your dog’s choice and watch him circle around you like
                    a Frisbee.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> When you’re playing with your dog, his attention is focused on you. And at that
                    time, he can learn and you can teach. So, use every opportunity you can.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Know when to stop</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Dogs can be a little too excited at times, not knowing when to stop. So, it becomes
                    your job. Be careful about how much you exercise your dog. Don’t overexert him. The younger the dog
                    is, the more careful you need to be.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> Also, younger dogs are really good at turning a deaf ear on you, so, you will
                    really need to apply yourself to train them. They are not used to almost anything, so teaching them
                    is quite a task. With dogs that are a little bit older, it is comparatively easier as they pick
                    things up faster. Dogs mature as they age as most animals do. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">How long should you train your dog</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Well, it depends on a lot of things. But you should consider not doing very long
                    sessions. An ideal session would be about 10 minutes. And you want to do it often. Have a lot of
                    10-minute sessions during the day, whenever possible. It is hard for dogs to keep their focus for
                    long periods of time and you need them to be attentive for you to train them. It is always best to
                    end a session before your dog gets frustrated.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> It can be a lot for him to take, so be patient about it. It is going to take time,
                    and in fairness, you will always have to teach him something. The process never really ends. The
                    first thing you need to teach your dog is to teach him how to learn.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Should you hire a trainer for your dog</h2>

                <p class="post-text">Well, it depends on your individual preference and situation. Is it possible to
                    train your dog yourself? Yes, it is absolutely possible to do that, but it will take time and
                    effort. There are tons of free resources on the internet that you can use. But if you can't do it
                    because of your job, you should definitely invest in training your dog. If your dog is trained
                    properly, he won’t damage the furniture in your absence and be comfortable around your guests.</p>
                <p class="post-text"> So, if you can’t devote your time and energy into training your dog yourself, sign
                    up for a training program.</p>
                <p class="post-text"></p>
            </div>

            <div class="col my-4">
                <h2 style="font-family: 'Bungee', cursive;">Conclusion</h2>

                <p class="post-text">You should at least give your dog some basic training, it is a necessity if you two
                    are to co-exist. You should start as early as you can and take it easy on your dog, give him time to
                    learn. He is an animal, his brain is not as big as yours. Make the experience rewarding and
                    fulfilling for your dog. Don’t overexert him, you need to be extra careful if you’re training a
                    young puppy. Divide the training into small fun bits and multiple times a day, instead of trying to
                    train him for one hour straight. And make sure your dog is always comfortable around you. You should
                    be able to trust your dog at all times and your dog should be able to trust you at all times.
                    Consider hiring a trainer if you don’t have the time or ability to do it yourself.</p>
